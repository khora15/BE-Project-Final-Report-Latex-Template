\large{\emph{A cloud user today needs to access his cloud system through the World Wide Web. Typically, the user logs in from his web browser on a site of the cloud provider and uses various web based protocols while doing so. This paper demonstrates the integration of cloud with Windows explorer rather than internet explorer. There would be no separate need to login into a cloud service provider account, as a 'My Cloud' option would be directly available where all the virtual machines on the cloud would be retrieved from the remote host and viewed locally. This integration makes the cloud more user friendly, more comprehendible and easily learnable because its interface seems much more familiar. Also, the unnecessary need to login would be removed.
