\chapter{Proposed Work}

\section{Problem Statement}
To integrate the cloud with Windows Explorer instead of the Internet explorer. To eliminate the need to log in into a cloud service provider account and instead, a 'My Cloud' folder would be directly available where all the virtual machines on the cloud would be retrieved from the remote host and viewed locally.



\section{Statement Of Scope}

  Today, to access the cloud, we need to log in to the web page of the Cloud service provider and put in our credentials to access our cloud. Our project helps reduce this step by directly integrating this cloud to our desktop.
Now, cloud computing providers can offer services at different layers of the resource stack, simulating the functions that are performed by applications (Software As A Service), operating systems(Platform As A Service), or physical hardware(Infrastructure As A Service).We are going to use Iaas model, wherin we get to rent Virtual Computers,called ‘Instances’ and pay-per-use. We can configure and run any machine on them as we wish,just like we use a physical machine.[5]
	A new folder called ‘My Cloud’ will be present on our Exlorer Directories and just by entering the folder, the user can access his cloud. He can see his list of V.M’s and choose to add or delte any of them,just like a regular file. Also,by right clicking,he can configure his V.M’s properties . Run and Stop options will also be only a click away.
Our project , basically, merges the cloud onto the desktop of the user.

\section{Features}

•  More comprehendible 
•	User friendly
•	No unnecessary log in.
•	Interface seems much more familiar

\section{Objective}

To eliminate the need to log in to a cloud service provider account, as a 'My Cloud' folder would be directly available where all the virtual machines on the cloud would be retrieved from the remote host and viewed locally by integrating the explorer instead of the internet explorer .
